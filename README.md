## What’s `nima`?

[R/nima](http://code.nimahejazi.org/nima) is a miscellaneous collection
of tools that have proven useful to me over years of statistical
research and scientific computing. This package is made public for my
own convenience, with no guarantees whatsoever – *caveat emptor:* use
`nima` only at your own risk. Since this [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
package is a quite eclectic collection of tools, consider consulting the
website accompanying the package
[here](http://code.nimahejazi.org/nima).
